# OTel Observability Migration — Cross-Service Plan

**Audience:** implementation agent (Claude Code or similar)
**Drop location:** copy this file to the root of each of the four repos as `.observability/OBSERVABILITY_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
**Source of truth:** this plan is ordered across four repos. The phase you can work on depends on which repo you are in AND which prior phases are complete. **Do not skip ahead. Pause checkpoints are mandatory.**

---

## Goal

Unified observability across four services using OpenTelemetry as the signal layer and a self-hosted Grafana stack (Tempo + Loki + Prometheus + Grafana) as the backend. The differentiating outcome is **distributed traces that cross async boundaries** — specifically Redis Streams (Synapse → Sentinel) and RabbitMQ (EventHorizon's internal stages).

## Services in scope

1. `sentinel-l7` (Laravel/PHP) — compliance engine, consumes axioms from Redis Streams
2. `EventHorizon` (TypeScript/Fastify) — four-stage telemetry pipeline over RabbitMQ + MongoDB
3. `synapse-l4` (Python/FastAPI) — LLM validation sidecar, emits to Sentinel via Redis Streams
4. `Ledger-L5` (Ruby/Rails) — invoicing against Sentinel customers (`~/dev/Ledger-L5`)

## Architecture target

```
[synapse-l4] ──┐
[sentinel-l7] ─┼─ OTLP → [otel-collector] ─┬→ Tempo  (traces)
[EventHorizon]─┤                            ├→ Loki   (logs)
[Ledger-L5]  ──┘                            └→ Prometheus (metrics)
                                              ↓
                                          [Grafana]
```

## Architectural posture: wide spans on pillar backend

The backend is the canonical OSS pillar stack (Tempo + Loki + Prometheus) because it is what most interviewers and most production teams recognize. The *instrumentation* is deliberately wider than a 1.0-style setup: every business-critical span carries as many high-cardinality attributes as the operation knows about — `source_id`, `customer_id`, `domain`, `status`, `anomaly_score`, `driver_used`, etc. Attributes that *could* be span attributes go on spans; we do not pre-aggregate them into Prometheus counters unless there's a concrete operational need.

The reasoning, which is worth being able to articulate verbatim in interviews:

> The pillar backend was a deliberate tradeoff. The wide-events model (Honeycomb, SigNoz, Clickhouse-based stacks) is genuinely better for arbitrary-cardinality debugging — but the pillar stack is more recognizable, has a much larger OSS community, and maps directly to what most companies run including those on Datadog. I instrumented for the wide-events model regardless: rich attributes on every span, queryable via TraceQL. If this needed to scale into production with real cardinality requirements, the migration path is swap Tempo+Prometheus for Clickhouse — the application instrumentation does not change.

This shapes every per-service phase below: when the choice is "Prometheus counter with N labels" vs "rich span attribute," default to span attribute.

## Sequencing rationale

- Synapse first because Logfire is already OTel under the hood — lowest activation energy, validates the pipeline end-to-end.
- Sentinel second because it consumes Synapse — together they prove cross-service trace propagation, the headline result.
- EventHorizon third because it is an independent pipeline; instrumenting it adds the second async boundary (RabbitMQ) to the story.
- Invoicer last because it is the least built — instrumenting too early means rework.

## How to use this plan

For each phase below:

1. Check which repo you are in. Skip phases that target other repos.
2. Check whether prior phases are complete (look for the completion marker in their respective repos: `.observability/phase-N-complete`).
3. If a prior phase is incomplete, **STOP** and surface this to the human — they will direct you to the correct repo.
4. When a phase finishes, write `.observability/phase-N-complete` with a one-line summary and commit it. Then **PAUSE** and tell the human the phase is done and which repo to move to next.

---

## Phase 0 — Observability infrastructure

**Repo:** new repo `cyber-rhizome/observability`, OR a sibling `infra/observability/` dir in `sentinel-l7`. Recommend new repo since it's shared across four services. Human decides.

**Goal:** local-runnable Grafana stack with OTel Collector accepting OTLP on 4317 (gRPC) and 4318 (HTTP).

**Tasks:**

1. `docker-compose.yml` with services: `otel-collector`, `tempo`, `loki`, `prometheus`, `grafana`.
2. `otel-collector-config.yaml`:
   - Receivers: `otlp` (grpc + http)
   - Processors: `batch`, `memory_limiter`
   - Exporters: `otlp/tempo`, `loki`, `prometheus`
3. Tempo config (`tempo.yaml`) — local block storage, no S3.
4. Loki config — local filesystem.
5. Prometheus config — scrape collector's `/metrics`.
6. Grafana provisioning: three datasources (Tempo, Loki, Prometheus) auto-configured. One starter dashboard.
7. `README.md` — `docker compose up` should produce a working stack on `localhost:3000` (Grafana).

**Definition of done:**

- `docker compose up` succeeds.
- A curl test (`curl -X POST localhost:4318/v1/traces` with a sample trace payload) produces a visible trace in Tempo via Grafana UI.

**Confidence flags:**

- Exact collector image tags drift — verify `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest` is current before pinning.
- Tempo's config schema has changed across minor versions; reference `grafana/tempo` docs for the current `local` storage block.

**PAUSE CHECKPOINT 0:** Stack must be running and a synthetic trace must be visible in Grafana before Phase 1 begins. Commit `.observability/phase-0-complete`.

**STATUS: ✓ Complete** — stack running at `~/dev/rhizome-observability`. Synthetic trace verified in Tempo. Marker: `.observability/phase-0-complete`.

---

## Phase 1 — Synapse-L4 (Python/FastAPI)

**Repo:** `synapse-l4`

**Goal:** Synapse emits OTLP traces to the collector. Trace context (`traceparent`) is propagated on Redis Stream XADD to Sentinel.

**Current state observed:**

- Logfire is already wired in `src/observation/instrumentation.py`.
- `src/nodes/emitter.py` has a `logfire.span("emit", ...)` around the Redis publish.
- `Axiom` payload carries `source_id` and `emitted_at` but no trace context.

**Tasks:**

1. Logfire's SDK already exports OTLP. Add config option to point the OTLP exporter at the local collector (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318`) instead of/alongside Logfire's hosted endpoint. Keep Logfire as an optional secondary exporter — do not rip it out.
2. In `src/clients/sentinel.py` (the Redis Streams client — verify path), inject the current trace context as a top-level XADD field named `traceparent`. Use the OTel propagator:
   ```python
   from opentelemetry.propagate import inject
   carrier = {}
   inject(carrier)  # populates {"traceparent": "00-...", "tracestate": "..."}
   ```
   Pass `carrier["traceparent"]` as a top-level field alongside `data`.
3. Make the `emit` span **wide**. Add as many high-cardinality attributes as the operation knows about: `source_id`, `status`, `anomaly_score`, `metric_value`, `domain`, `axiom.emitted_at`. Use OTel attribute API directly rather than going through Logfire's helpers, so the attribute names follow OTel semantic conventions where applicable. The earlier Judge/Extract spans should be similarly widened with `judge.confidence`, `extract.model`, `extract.tokens_in/out` — anything that might be useful to slice by later.
4. **Do not** modify the existing `Axiom` Pydantic model. The `traceparent` is a transport-layer concern, not a business identity concern. Carry it on the stream entry, not inside the JSON payload.

**Definition of done:**

- Triggering a Synapse pipeline run produces a trace visible in Tempo.
- The trace shows the `emit` span with `source_id` as an attribute.
- Inspecting the resulting Redis Stream entry (`XREAD STREAMS synapse:axioms 0`) shows `traceparent` as a top-level field.

**Confidence flags:**

- Logfire+OTel interop: high confidence Logfire SDK respects `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, but verify against current Pydantic Logfire docs before committing the config.
- The exact path of the Redis client in this repo: pattern-matched from memory, verify before editing.

**As-built notes (Phase 1 complete):**

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is read by Pydantic Settings into `config.otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint`; the `/v1/traces` path is appended in `instrumentation.py` when constructing `OTLPSpanExporter`.
- Logfire v3 `configure()` accepts `additional_span_processors: list[SpanProcessor]` — this is the dual-export mechanism. Logfire is retained as an optional secondary backend.
- **`service_name` must be passed explicitly** to `logfire.configure(service_name="synapse-l4")`. Without it Tempo shows `unknown_service`. The `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` env var also works but is less reliable than the explicit parameter. This will bite every subsequent service — see note in Phase 2 confidence flags.
- `traceparent` is injected only when `inject(carrier)` produces a non-empty carrier (i.e. when there is an active span). No active span → no field written → Sentinel-L7 must handle the absent key gracefully.
- Actual `traceparent` format confirmed on stream: `00-<32-hex-trace-id>-<16-hex-span-id>-01`.

**PAUSE CHECKPOINT 1:** Synapse traces visible in Tempo; `traceparent` confirmed on stream entries. Commit `.observability/phase-1-complete`. **Pause before starting Phase 2.**

**STATUS: ✓ Complete** — traces visible in Tempo under service `synapse-l4`; `traceparent` field confirmed on `synapse:axioms` stream entries. Marker: `.observability/phase-1-complete`.

---

## Phase 2 — Sentinel-L7 (Laravel/PHP)

**Repo:** `sentinel-l7`

**Goal:** Sentinel extracts `traceparent` from incoming Redis Stream messages and continues the trace as a child span. End-to-end Synapse → Sentinel trace becomes visible.

**Current state observed:**

- `app/Services/AxiomStreamService.php` reads via `XREADGROUP` and parses flat field arrays.
- `app/Services/AxiomProcessorService.php` processes a single Axiom and routes to AI driver.
- All logging is Laravel `Log::` (Monolog). No trace context anywhere.

**Tasks:**

1. Install OTel:
   - `composer require open-telemetry/sdk open-telemetry/exporter-otlp`
   - For Laravel auto-instrumentation: `composer require open-telemetry/opentelemetry-auto-laravel` (verify current package name before installing).
2. Bootstrap the SDK in `config/otel.php` or via a service provider. Point OTLP at `http://localhost:4318`.
3. In `AxiomStreamService::parseFields()`, surface `traceparent` as a separate return value, not inside the parsed Axiom data. Suggested signature change: return `['fields' => [...], 'traceparent' => '...' | null]`. **Do not** add `traceparent` to the `ComplianceEvent` model or DB schema — it is transport-layer only.
4. In `AxiomProcessorService::process()`, extract the trace context using the OTel propagator and start the work as a child span:
   ```php
   $context = TraceContextPropagator::getInstance()
       ->extract(['traceparent' => $traceparent]);
   $span = $tracer->spanBuilder('axiom.process')
       ->setParent($context)
       ->startSpan();
   ```
   Make this span **wide**. Add every attribute the processing decision touches: `source_id`, `anomaly_score`, `metric_value`, `domain`, `status`, `routed_to_ai`, `risk_level`, `driver_used`, `threshold`, `is_duplicate`, `elapsed_ms`. The `routeToAi()` and `recordSubThreshold()` paths should each get their own child span with the AI driver result fully attributed: `ai.driver`, `ai.confidence`, `ai.policy_refs`, `ai.narrative_length`. Anything you might want to filter or group by in a query goes on a span.
5. New code goes under `app/Services/Compliance/` per repo convention — likely a thin `TraceContextExtractor` helper.
6. **Do not** modify `AxiomStreamService::publish()` to add traceparent on the outbound side yet. There are no current consumers of Sentinel-side publishes; this is YAGNI. Wait until it hurts.

**Definition of done:**

- A Synapse pipeline run produces a single trace in Tempo with at least two services in the waterfall (`synapse-l4.emit` parent → `sentinel-l7.axiom.process` child).
- The trace shows the AI driver call as a further child span (auto-instrumented HTTP).
- `source_id` is queryable as a span attribute in both services.

**Confidence flags:**

- **`service.name` must be set explicitly** — without it Tempo shows `unknown_service`. In PHP, set `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=sentinel-l7` as an env var before the SDK bootstraps, or pass it in the SDK configuration. This burned time in Phase 1 (Python); don't repeat it here.
- PHP OTel auto-instrumentation packages are less mature than Python/Node equivalents. The `auto-laravel` package may require manual span wiring for Redis (predis is not always auto-instrumented). Budget extra time here.
- The PHP SDK requires the OTel PECL extension OR runs in pure PHP mode — verify Render's PHP image supports the chosen path.

**ADR consideration:** This introduces a new cross-cutting concern. Worth a short ADR documenting "trace context is transport-layer, not domain-layer" — i.e. why traceparent doesn't land in `ComplianceEvent`.

**As-built notes (Phase 2 complete):**

- `open-telemetry/sdk` 1.14.0 + `open-telemetry/exporter-otlp` 1.4.0 installed. Pure PHP mode — no PECL extension required.
- `OtelServiceProvider` bootstraps `TracerProvider` with `BatchSpanProcessor` → `OtlpHttpTransportFactory` (protobuf, port 4318). Registered in `bootstrap/providers.php`.
- `TraceContextExtractor` in `app/Services/Compliance/` wraps `TraceContextPropagator::getInstance()->extract()`. Empty carrier when `$traceparent` is null → new root span (graceful absent-key handling).
- `AxiomProcessorService` takes `?TracerProviderInterface $tracerProvider = null` as an optional constructor param. Defaults to `Globals::tracerProvider()` → `NoopTracerProvider` in tests. Laravel DI injects the real provider in production.
- `TraceContextExtractor $extractor = new TraceContextExtractor()` uses PHP 8.1+ "new in initializers" — existing unit tests that do `new AxiomProcessorService($driver)` continue working unchanged.
- Three spans emitted per AI-routed Axiom: `axiom.process` (root/child), `axiom.ai_analysis` (child), and implicitly the HTTP span to Gemini/OpenRouter (auto-instrumented if HTTP auto-instrumentation is added later).
- `BatchSpanProcessor` chosen over `SimpleSpanProcessor` — avoids per-span blocking in the worker loop. Trade-off: spans lost on unclean shutdown without explicit `$provider->shutdown()`. Acceptable for dev; PCNTL signal handler deferred.
- ADR-0024 documents the transport-layer isolation decision.

**PAUSE CHECKPOINT 2:** End-to-end Synapse → Sentinel trace must be visible. Commit `.observability/phase-2-complete`. **Pause before starting Phase 3.**

**STATUS: ✓ Complete** — SDK bootstrapped; `axiom.process`, `axiom.ai_analysis`, `axiom.sub_threshold` spans instrumented; `traceparent` extracted from stream entries. 45 tests pass. Marker: `.observability/phase-2-complete`.

---

## Phase 3 — EventHorizon (TypeScript/Fastify)

**Repo:** `EventHorizon`

**Goal:** All four pipeline stages (ingest → process → store → observe) emit traces. Trace context propagates through RabbitMQ message headers. The known silent-drop issue becomes visible via span events.

**Current state observed:**

- Logging is `console.log/warn/error` with bracketed prefixes — structured by convention only.
- `src/observation/metrics.ts` does in-memory metric counting, not exported.
- No trace context anywhere.

**Tasks:**

1. Install OTel:
   - `npm i @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions`
2. Create `src/observation/tracing.ts` that initializes the Node SDK before any other imports. Wire into both entry points (`src/server.ts` and `src/processing/worker.ts`) as the **first** import.
3. Auto-instrumentation will cover Fastify, http, amqplib, MongoDB out of the box. Verify each shows up.
4. For RabbitMQ propagation:
   - On publish (ingest → process boundary): inject the current context into message `properties.headers` in `queue.ts::publishEvent()`.
   - On consume (worker side): extract context from `msg.properties.headers` in `worker.ts` and run the handler within that context using `context.with()`.
5. Replace `console.*` calls with the OTel logs API OR with a structured logger (pino) configured to export via OTLP. Recommend pino + `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-pino` for least churn.
6. The current silent-drop on malformed messages (known issue) should become a span event with `exception.type` and `exception.message` plus the raw message attributes attached. The drop is now a queryable span, not just a counter — you can ask "show me all dropped messages from the last hour grouped by exception.type" via TraceQL. Keep one Prometheus counter (`dropped_messages_total`) for alerting purposes only; everything else is on spans.
7. Each of the four pipeline stages emits a **wide** span: ingest span carries `http.route`, `payload.size_bytes`, `event.id`, `event.type`, `event.source`; process span carries `event.id`, `event.type`, `classification`, `classification.tags`, `retry.count`, `msg.routing_key`, `write.collection`; observe span carries `event.id`, `event.type`, `subscribers.count`, `fanout.duration_ms`, `changeStream.lag_ms`. Replace the in-memory counters in `metrics.ts` with span attributes wherever possible — only keep Prometheus counters for things that need to drive alerts (queue depth, drop rate).

**Definition of done:**

- A single ingested event produces a four-stage trace in Tempo: HTTP ingest → AMQP publish → AMQP consume → MongoDB write → WebSocket fanout.
- Forcing a malformed message produces a visible span with an exception event AND increments the drop counter in Prometheus.
- Existing tests still pass.

**Confidence flags:**

- **ESM entry-point ordering**: There are two separate process entry points (`src/server.ts` and `src/processing/worker.ts`). Both must import `./observation/tracing.js` (or `../observation/tracing.js`) as their **first** import. The plan originally referenced a `-r` flag or `src/index.ts` — neither applies here. With tsx + Node ESM, adding the tracing import first in each entry file ensures the SDK initializes before any instrumented module is evaluated (ESM evaluates imports depth-first, left-to-right).
- **amqplib header filtering**: amqplib encodes non-string header values (e.g. `x-retry-count`) as Buffer objects. When extracting the OTel carrier from `msg.properties.headers`, filter to string-valued keys only — otherwise `propagation.extract()` receives unexpected types.
- **`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`**: Must be set explicitly. Without it Tempo shows `unknown_service`. Set via env var or hardcode in `tracing.ts`.

**As-built notes (Phase 3 complete):**

- `@opentelemetry/sdk-node` 0.218.0 + `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node` 0.76.0 + `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http` 0.218.0 installed.
- `src/observation/tracing.ts` — `NodeSDK` + `OTLPTraceExporter` + `getNodeAutoInstrumentations()` (fs instrumentation disabled — too noisy). `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` defaults to `"event-horizon"`.
- **First import** pattern: `import "./observation/tracing.js"` added as line 1 in `src/server.ts`; `import "../observation/tracing.js"` as line 1 in `src/processing/worker.ts`. ESM evaluation order guarantees the SDK initializes first.
- **RabbitMQ inject** (`queue.ts::publishEvent`): `propagation.inject(context.active(), headers)` called before `channel.publish()`. The populated `headers` object is passed as part of publish options.
- **RabbitMQ extract** (`worker.ts` consume handler): `msgHeaders` filtered to `Record<string, string>` before passing to `propagation.extract()`. Worker span started as `SpanKind.CONSUMER` with `parentCtx`. Entire handler body runs inside `context.with(trace.setSpan(parentCtx, span), ...)`.
- **Parse-failure span events**: `SyntaxError` (bad JSON) and `ZodError` (schema mismatch) caught in the worker's error path. `span.addEvent("message.parse_failed", {...})` surfaces the exception type, message, routing key, message size, and retry count — all queryable via TraceQL.
- **Wide process span attributes**: `event.id`, `event.type`, `event.source`, `event.timestamp`, `classification`, `classification.tags`, `retry.count`, `msg.routing_key`, `write.collection`.
- **Observe span** (`server.ts` `onInsert` callback): `event.observe` span wraps `recordInsert()` + `broadcast()`. Attributes: `event.id`, `event.type`, `subscribers.count` (via new `getConnectionCount()` export from `wsServer.ts`), `fanout.duration_ms`, `changeStream.lag_ms`.
- **Ingest span widen** (`event.routes.ts`): `trace.getActiveSpan()` used to add `event.id`, `event.type`, `event.source`, `payload.size_bytes` to the Fastify auto-instrumented HTTP span. Validation failures add a `validation.failed` span event.
- `getConnectionCount()` added to `wsServer.ts` — returns `clients.size`.
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` added to `.env.example`.
- 44 tests pass unchanged — OTel SDK in tests uses `NoopTracerProvider` (no collector needed).
- Console.* logging retained — pino migration deferred (Phase 5 scope).

**PAUSE CHECKPOINT 3:** Four-stage EventHorizon trace visible; malformed-message drops now produce observable signals. Commit `.observability/phase-3-complete`. **Pause before starting Phase 4.**

**STATUS: ✓ Complete** — SDK bootstrapped; RabbitMQ context propagation wired; wide spans on all four pipeline stages; parse-failure span events surfaced. 44 tests pass. Marker: `.observability/phase-3-complete`.

**Post-completion extensions (EventHorizon project phases 16–19, 2026-06-14 → 06-15):**

Phase 3's exit criteria (four-stage trace, span-event drops) were met with the NoopTracerProvider and no live backend. The following work hardened that against the real `rhizome-lens` stack and added the pipeline-internal signals the trace layer can't carry. These are EventHorizon-local follow-ups — they do **not** change the cross-service sequencing and Phase 4 (invoicer) remains the next plan phase.

- **P16 — Live validation + bugfix + first dashboard.** Ran the full OTel pipeline against the live stack (Tempo/Loki/Prometheus/Grafana). Fixed a `Buffer.byteLength` bug in `event.routes.ts` that the `app.inject()` tests had masked via optional-chaining short-circuit (`a9e2e4a`). Built the "EventHorizon Service" Grafana dashboard (RED metrics + Node.js runtime health) **entirely from existing auto-instrumentation** — no new instrumentation code. This is the EventHorizon slice of Phase 5 landing early (see Phase 5 note).
- **P17 — Fault injection for demo traffic.** Opt-in, both default 0 and off unless set: `CHAOS_ERROR_RATE` (server, `config.ts`/`event.routes.ts`) throws *after* validation to produce real 500s; `--error-rate` (seed producer) sends a malformed `id` to trigger real 422s. Live-verified mixed 202/422/500 in Tempo and Prometheus; added a "Recent Traces" TraceQL table panel to the dashboard.
- **P18 — Custom metric instruments for pipeline-internal signals.** Three signals the RED/auto-instrumentation dashboard cannot see were exported via the env-configured `MeterProvider` (no new wiring in `tracing.ts`): `events.processed` Counter → `events_processed_total{event_type="pipeline|sensor|app"}` (worker ack path); `events.failed` Counter → `events_failed_total{event_type, failure_reason="parse_error|schema_error|processing_error"}` (worker retry-exhaustion path — the async-failure signal the HTTP 5xx panel can't see, and the *processing-failure subset* of dead-letters, not the total); and `eventhorizon.change_stream.lag` ObservableGauge → `eventhorizon_change_stream_lag_milliseconds`. `queueDepth` is **deliberately not** exported from EventHorizon — it comes from RabbitMQ's own `rabbitmq_prometheus` exporter so the broker stays the single source of truth. Governed by **ADR 0016 → ADR 0017** (see the refined anti-goal below). Live-verified: 25/35/36 processed-by-type split, lag gauge 0ms.

**Cross-repo item (resolved in `rhizome-lens`):** EventHorizon's `docker-compose.yml` publishes RabbitMQ's Prometheus port `15692` on the host (`cc05a81`). The matching **Prometheus scrape job for `rabbitmq_prometheus`** is now shipped here — see the `rabbitmq` job in `prometheus.yml` (scraping `host.docker.internal:15692` at `/metrics/per-object` via host-gateway, required on Linux/WSL2). Grafana can read `rabbitmq_queue_messages{queue="events.dead"}` (the total dead-letter signal that complements `events_failed_total`) and queue depth. EventHorizon's own custom metrics already reach Prometheus via the OTLP collector — no extra scrape job needed for those.

---

## Phase 4 — Ledger-L5 (Ruby invoicer)

**Repo:** `Ledger-L5` (`~/dev/Ledger-L5`, Ruby/Rails)

**Goal:** Invoicer is instrumented from day one. Any HTTP calls to Sentinel automatically propagate trace context, linking invoicing flows back to the underlying compliance events they bill against.

**Tasks:**

1. Install gems:
   - `opentelemetry-sdk`
   - `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp`
   - `opentelemetry-instrumentation-all` (or pick the specific instrumentations for the chosen framework — Rails, Sinatra, Roda)
2. Configure in an initializer:
   ```ruby
   OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
     c.service_name = 'ledger-l5'
     c.use_all  # auto-instrument everything available
   end
   ```
3. Outbound HTTP calls to Sentinel will automatically inject `traceparent` headers. On the Sentinel side, the Laravel auto-instrumentation from Phase 2 should pick this up automatically — verify the trace links across.
4. Add manual spans around business operations: `invoice.generate`, `invoice.send`, `invoice.mark_paid`. Make these **wide**. Attributes: `customer_id`, `invoice_id`, `amount_cents`, `currency`, `line_items.count`, `period.start`, `period.end`, `billing.plan`, `payment.method`, `email.template_id`. The point is that "which customer hit the longest invoice generation time last month" becomes a TraceQL query, not a custom metric you have to think about in advance.

**Definition of done:**

- Generating a test invoice that queries Sentinel produces a trace spanning both services in Tempo.
- The trace shows Ruby spans (ledger-l5 `invoice.generate`) → HTTP call → Sentinel spans (the existing compliance query handler).

**Confidence flags:**

- Ruby OTel is mature but the `use_all` autoload can be slow on startup. If invoicer becomes a CLI tool rather than a long-running server, prefer explicit `c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Faraday'` etc.

**PAUSE CHECKPOINT 4:** Ruby → Sentinel trace links visible. Commit `.observability/phase-4-complete`.

---

## Phase 5 — Logs and dashboards polish (defer until interview prep needs it)

**Repos:** all four

This phase is decorative compared to traces. The interview talking point is "distributed tracing across async boundaries in four languages" — that lives entirely in phases 0–4. Defer this phase until you have a concrete need (e.g. dashboard screenshots for portfolio site).

**Partial early landing (EventHorizon):** the EventHorizon dashboard slice of this phase is already built — the "EventHorizon Service" Grafana dashboard (RED + Node.js runtime + a "Recent Traces" TraceQL panel + per-type throughput and change-stream-lag panels off the Phase-18 custom metrics). Pulling it forward was justified by the live-validation and fault-injection demo need (project phases 16–18); it does not unblock or reorder the remaining services. Logs-via-Loki and the other three services' dashboards remain deferred.

**Partial early landing (Sentinel-L7), 2026-06-16:** the "Sentinel-L7 Service" Grafana dashboard (`grafana/provisioning/dashboards/sentinel-l7-service.json`) is built and live-verified. Unlike EventHorizon (PromQL off Node auto-instrumentation), **every panel is a TraceQL query over the wide `axiom.process` / `axiom.ai_analysis` span attributes** — no pre-aggregated Prometheus counters, the canonical posture for this section. 9 panels: throughput by `risk_level` / `domain` / `routed_to_ai` (`rate()`), processing latency p50/p95/p99 (`quantile_over_time(duration, …)`), anomaly-score and AI-confidence avg/max (see attribute-quantile note below), AI-by-driver, plus AI-error and recent-Axiom trace tables. Logs-via-Loki for Sentinel remains deferred (Sentinel still logs via Monolog, not OTLP→Loki).

**As-built notes (Sentinel-L7 dashboard):**

- **Tempo bumped 2.6.1 → 2.7.2.** Needed because `avg/min/max_over_time` over span *attributes* 500'd on 2.6.1 ("unexpected IDENTIFIER"); they work on 2.7.2.
- **`metrics_generator` enabled with the `local-blocks` processor** (`tempo.yaml`), queried directly via the Tempo datasource — no Prometheus `remote_write`. Required `overrides.defaults.metrics_generator.processors: [local-blocks]`.
- **`filter_server_spans: false` is mandatory.** Tempo 2.7's `local_blocks` defaults this to `true`, which silently drops all non-`SERVER` spans from metrics. Sentinel's `axiom.process` / `axiom.ai_analysis` spans are `SpanKind=INTERNAL`, so without this the generator received spans but produced zero metric series (search worked, all metrics queries returned empty).
- **TraceQL `quantile_over_time` / `histogram_over_time` only work over the `duration` intrinsic, not arbitrary numeric attributes — even on 2.7.2.** So true percentiles exist only for latency (P3, off span `duration`). `.anomaly_score` and `.ai.confidence` distribution panels use `avg`/`max`/`min_over_time` instead. (Migration path to real attribute percentiles: a later Tempo, or a histogram metric.)
- **Span-duration metrics return values in seconds** — the latency panel unit is `s`, not `ms`.
- **`recordException` does not set span status to error.** `AxiomProcessorService::routeToAi()` calls `recordException()` on a driver failure, which emits an `exception` span *event* but leaves status unset (`span.error` is never true). So the "AI Errors" panel filters on `event:name = "exception"`, not `status=error`.
- Editing a bind-mounted config then `docker compose restart`-ing fails on Docker Desktop + WSL2 (stale mount); use `docker compose up -d --force-recreate <svc>`.

**Enabling the AI panels (P6 "AI Analysis by Driver", P7 "AI Confidence") later — required steps:**

The `axiom.ai_analysis` success-path attributes (`ai.driver`, `ai.confidence`) are only set when `ComplianceDriver::analyze()` returns *without* throwing. In dev the call throws (placeholder API key), so those attributes are absent and the failures surface in the P8 exception-events table instead. To populate P6/P7:

1. **Provide a working AI credential for the active driver** (`SENTINEL_AI_DRIVER` in Sentinel's env):
   - `openrouter` → real `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (+ `OPENROUTER_MODEL`)
   - `gemini` → real `GEMINI_API_KEY` (+ `GEMINI_FLASH_URL`)
2. **Send Axioms with `anomaly_score > AXIOM_AUDIT_THRESHOLD` (default 0.8)** so they route to `routeToAi()`. Sub-threshold Axioms never emit `axiom.ai_analysis` attributes.
3. **Worker running** (`php artisan sentinel:watch-axioms`) exporting to the collector, with the Tempo metrics-generator live.

Once a driver call succeeds, P6 shows throughput split by `ai.driver` and P7 shows avg/min `ai.confidence`. No dashboard change is needed — the queries are already correct.

When ready:

- Ship logs via OTel Collector → Loki from each service (most SDKs support this in the same OTLP exporter).
- Build dashboards that answer business questions via TraceQL queries over wide span attributes — not via pre-aggregated Prometheus counters. Example queries to support:
  - "Axioms processed per minute, grouped by domain" → TraceQL over `axiom.process` spans grouped by `domain` attribute.
  - "Anomaly score distribution by driver" → TraceQL over `axiom.process` spans, histogram of `anomaly_score` faceted by `driver_used`.
  - "Invoice amount totals by customer" → TraceQL over `invoice.generate` spans grouped by `customer_id`.
- Reserve Prometheus counters exclusively for alerting signals where you need pre-aggregated rates (queue depth, drop rate, error rate). These are operational signals, not analytics. Everything analytics-shaped stays on spans.
- Build one Grafana dashboard per service plus one "executive" dashboard showing the full system. Each panel should ideally be a TraceQL query, not a PromQL query.

## Interview narrative artifacts (parallel, not blocking)

Whenever a phase completes, update the corresponding repo's README with an "Observability" section. Recommended structure:

- One sentence on the signal stack (OTel → Collector → Tempo/Loki/Prometheus → Grafana).
- A bullet on cross-service propagation specifically (this is the differentiator).
- A link or embedded screenshot of an example trace.

A portfolio-level architecture diagram showing the full system with trace flow arrows belongs in the `observability` repo's README, not duplicated in each service.

## Anti-goals (do not do these without a concrete trigger)

- Do not add Temporal. Async durability is already handled by Redis Streams consumer groups and RabbitMQ — adding Temporal duplicates infrastructure for no current gain. (Separate conversation: Temporal makes sense if the invoicer grows into a multi-step durable workflow. Wait until it hurts.)
- Do not add `traceparent` to the `Axiom` Pydantic model or `ComplianceEvent` DB schema. Transport-layer concern.
- Do not expand OTel instrumentation to cover every function — auto-instrumentation plus manual spans on business-critical operations is the right granularity. Adding spans for trivial helpers creates noise.
- Do not silently replace Logfire with raw OTel in Synapse. Logfire IS OTel; keep it as an exporter option.
- **Do not pre-aggregate business attributes into Prometheus counters.** `axioms_by_domain_total{domain="..."}`, `invoice_amount_by_customer_total{customer_id="..."}` — these belong as wide span attributes queryable via TraceQL, not as pre-committed metric dimensions. Prometheus counters are reserved for things that drive alerts (rates, error counts, queue depth). The discipline matters because once a Prometheus counter exists, people start querying it instead of the spans, and the wide-attribute story degrades over time.
  - **Documented exception (EventHorizon, ADR 0016 → 0017):** `events_processed_total{event_type}` and `events_failed_total{event_type, failure_reason}` *are* sanctioned counters. They pass the refined test, not break the rule: `event.type` is a **closed three-value enum** (no cardinality commitment at write time), and they are **rate/SLO signals that must be sampling-independent** — a throughput rate or failure rate cannot be reconstructed from sampled traces. The discipline still binds open-ended dimensions (`source`, `id`, `customer_id`, `domain`): those stay span-only. Before adding any pipeline counter, apply the ADR-0017 test — *alert/SLO + sampling-independent + bounded label set → instrument; otherwise → span attribute.*

## When this plan is fully executed

You will have:

- One unified observability backend (pillar-aligned OSS stack: Tempo + Loki + Prometheus).
- Distributed traces across four languages.
- Trace context propagating across two distinct async boundaries (Redis Streams, RabbitMQ).
- **Wide, high-cardinality spans** on every business-critical operation — instrumented for the wide-events model even though the backend is pillar-aligned.
- A concrete answer to "tell me about a time you improved system reliability through observability" — you built the layer.
- A direct mapping to Owner's stated stack (Datadog ≈ Grafana stack; OTel is vendor-neutral and well-understood by both).
- A defensible answer to the architectural-tradeoff question (see "Architectural posture" above): you can speak to the wide-events vs three-pillars debate, name what you chose, name what you'd do at scale, and name the migration path.
